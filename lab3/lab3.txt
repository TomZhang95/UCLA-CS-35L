Make a new directory called lab3
emacs 
M-x make-directory Enter lab3 Enter

Downloading the package by using:
wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

Then untar the package using command:
tar -xzvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

After reading INSTALL file in coreutils-7.6, configure, build and 
install the package by using:
./configure; make; make install

Running command:
export LC_ALL='en_US.UTF-8'
ls -l /bin/bash 

by running these in host directory under en_US.UTF-8 
environment shows the result:
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 960616 Oct 17 03:05 /bin/bash

which is correct(Unix format), but it suppose to show the wrong type 
which is in YYYY-MM-DD format. The reason is probably because I am using
a Mac OS X operating system or it already has an bug-fixed version coreutils
installed already. 
(Therefore, I couldn't follow exactly same as what the 
instruction says in assignment, what I did is run the ls of unfixed 
coreutils-7.6 first, recored the output, then apply the patch, install it, 
and re-run the new ls and recored the output and compare two result.)

Therefor, I went into ~/coreutils-7.6/src directory by using:
cd ~/lab3/coreutils-7.6/src

and run the ls command under /src directory by using command: 
./ls -l ~/ans1.txt and ./ls ~/oldFile

and output shows:
-rw-r--r-- 1 zhangt csugrad 2579 2017-01-12 18:48 /u/cs/ugrad/zhangt/ans1.txt

-rw-r--r-- 1 zhangt csugrad 0 1990-06-20 15:25 /u/cs/ugrad/zhangt/oldFile

which shows there is something need to patch into ls command under
coreutils 7.6

By checking Brady's patch, it shows that the new lines should be in
file ls.c

Creating a new file called PATCH under /src, copy and paste the 
content from Brady's patch, change the directory from a/src/ls.c to 
~/lab3/coreutils-7.6/src/ls.c 

Patching the file by using command:
patch ls.c PATCH

Then build again by using:
make

Then run the ls on a recent and old file under /src again:
./ls -l ~/ans1.txt and ./ls ~/oldFile

This time it shows the correct format which is:
-rw-r--r-- 1 zhangt csugrad 2579 Jan 12 18:48 /u/cs/ugrad/zhangt/ans1.txt

-rw-r--r-- 1 zhangt csugrad 0 Jun 20  1990 /u/cs/ugrad/zhangt/oldFile

The patch works.
