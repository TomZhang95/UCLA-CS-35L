Server-Side:
1. At the beginning, I installed openssh-server and openssh-client by using: 
dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh
sudo apt-get install openssh-server

2. Generating public and private key pairs with file name TomKey.pub:
ssh-keygen

The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|   o+o  .oo*o    |
|     .o.o =      |
|      ...+ o     |
|       ...  .    |
|    . + S +      |
|     O = + .     |
|    = * * +o     |
|   . + o #o+o    |
|    . E.=o@o     |
+----[SHA256]-----+

3. Then use following commands to create our own server:
ssh-keygen (make public and private RSA keys)
sudo useradd -d /home/Tom -m Tom
sudo passwd Tom

4. Then create a directory for clients, and give clients full permission on that
 directory
cd /home/Tom
sudo mkdir .ssh
sudo chown -R Tom .ssh
sudo chmod 700 .ssh

Client-Side:
1. By using "$ ifconfig" command, I got my IP address: 172.30.57.141

2. Copy my public key to my teammate's server for key-based authentication:
ssh-copy-id –i TomKey.pub yizhu@172.30.17.99
ssh-copy-id –i TomKey.pub leo@172.30.13.42

3. Then add private key to authentication agent :
ssh-add TomKey

4. Then I can access my teammate's server without using password:
ssh yizhu@172.30.17.99
leo@172.30.13.42

5. I ran several commands on those two remote host at the end, those commands works
 well and GUI shows up:
$ xterm, $ gedit, $ firefox
