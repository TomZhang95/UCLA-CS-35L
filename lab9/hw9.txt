1. create hw9.txt

2. check out the v3.0 directory while creating new branch:
git checkout v3.0 -b quote

3. Apply my patch to this new branch:
patch -p1 < ~/lab9/diffutils-3.0-patch/quote-3.0-patch.txt

patching file src/cmp.c
patching file src/diff.c
patching file src/diff3.c
patching file src/dir.c
patching file src/sdiff.c
patching file src/util.c

4. 5. Use emacs open 6 modified files, and use C-x 4 a to create ChangeLog file and
add relevant changing explanation to it, 

6. Then add and commit ChangeLog to branch:
git add .
git commit -F ChangeLog

You can suppress this message by setting them explicitly:

After doing this, you may fix the identity used for this commit with:

    git commit --amend --reset-author

 7 files changed, 741 insertions(+), 56 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 src/#cmp.c#

(*#cmp.c# is a file created automatically by linux server, which is not one of the original file, 
but it won't effect anything of diffutils, and I deleted it manualy)

7. Generate a formatted patch:
git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt 

8. Partner: Reinaldo Daniswara
Checking out v3.0 into new branch partner:
git checkout -f v3.0
git checkout -b partner

Then I get my partner's formatted patch, and applied the patch:
git am < formatted-patch-rei.txt

Then build the resulting system and check:
./bootstrap
./configure
make
make check

It works fine.


9. Then use the command make distdir:
make distdir

Then a directory "diffutils-3.0.1-60aa" was created, and the ChangeLog file inside recorded
the commit messages I wrote.


10. Install XQuartz, and enable X11 when log into linux server, then change directory to ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs
and run gitk:
ssh -X zhangt@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu
cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs
gitk

Then I found the newest merge which not newer than 2015-01-05 is the one below:
