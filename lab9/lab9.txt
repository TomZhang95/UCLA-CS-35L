1. clone diffutils from git: 
git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/diffutils.git

2. get a log of changes and put into git-log.txt:
git log > git-log.txt

3. get a list of tags and put into git-tag.txt:
git tag > git-tags.txt

4. Find the commit entitled “maint: quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like 
this'”, and generate a patch for that commit, putting it into the file quote-
patch.txt:
emacs git-log.txt
c-s maint: quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this'
copy the commit number
git show 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f > quote-patch.txt

5. go into diffutils v3.0
git checkout v3.0

6. apply the patch to diffutils v3.0
patch -p1 < quote-patch.txt

There are 3 patches which cannot find the correct directory, type return to skip
 them.

7. Check the status by using git status, there are some modified files tracked:
# HEAD detached at v3.0
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#	modified:   NEWS
#	modified:   README
#	modified:   TODO
#	modified:   doc/diagmeet.note
#	modified:   ms/config.bat
#	modified:   ms/config.site
#	modified:   po/en.po
#	modified:   src/analyze.c
#	modified:   src/cmp.c
#	modified:   src/context.c
#	modified:   src/diff.c
#	modified:   src/diff.h
#	modified:   src/diff3.c
#	modified:   src/dir.c
#	modified:   src/ifdef.c
#	modified:   src/io.c
#	modified:   src/sdiff.c
#	modified:   src/side.c
#	modified:   src/system.h
#	modified:   src/util.c
#	modified:   tests/help-version

8. Use  vc-diff (C-x v =) and vc-revert (C-x v u) in emacs to revert changes made 
to non .c files within emacs:
[zhangt@lnxsrv07 ~/lab9/diffutils]$ emacs NEWS
[zhangt@lnxsrv07 ~/lab9/diffutils]$ emacs README
[zhangt@lnxsrv07 ~/lab9/diffutils]$ emacs TODO
[zhangt@lnxsrv07 ~/lab9/diffutils]$ emacs doc/diagmeet.note
[zhangt@lnxsrv07 ~/lab9/diffutils]$ emacs ms/config.bat
[zhangt@lnxsrv07 ~/lab9/diffutils]$ emacs ms/config.site
[zhangt@lnxsrv07 ~/lab9/diffutils]$ emacs po/en.po
[zhangt@lnxsrv07 ~/lab9/diffutils]$ emacs src/diff.h
[zhangt@lnxsrv07 ~/lab9/diffutils]$ emacs src/system.h
[zhangt@lnxsrv07 ~/lab9/diffutils]$ emacs tests/help-version

9. Then use C-x v = C-u C-c C-a to undo the hunks of each .c file manuely within 
emacs:
[zhangt@lnxsrv07 ~/lab9/diffutils]$ emacs src/analyze.c
[zhangt@lnxsrv07 ~/lab9/diffutils]$ emacs src/cmp.c
[zhangt@lnxsrv07 ~/lab9/diffutils]$ emacs src/context.c
[zhangt@lnxsrv07 ~/lab9/diffutils]$ emacs src/diff.c
[zhangt@lnxsrv07 ~/lab9/diffutils]$ emacs src/diff3.c
[zhangt@lnxsrv07 ~/lab9/diffutils]$ emacs src/dir.c
[zhangt@lnxsrv07 ~/lab9/diffutils]$ emacs src/ifdef.c
[zhangt@lnxsrv07 ~/lab9/diffutils]$ emacs src/io.c
[zhangt@lnxsrv07 ~/lab9/diffutils]$ emacs src/sdiff.c
[zhangt@lnxsrv07 ~/lab9/diffutils]$ emacs src/side.c
[zhangt@lnxsrv07 ~/lab9/diffutils]$ emacs src/util.c

also undo all the changes to .c files other than changes to character string constants

check again by using git status, I got:
# HEAD detached at v3.0
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#	modified:   src/cmp.c
#	modified:   src/diff.c
#	modified:   src/diff3.c
#	modified:   src/dir.c
#	modified:   src/sdiff.c
#	modified:   src/util.c



10. I examined src/diff.c.rej and src/diff3.c.rej and found that all rejected lines
are caused by `, therefore I search that character by using C-s within emacs and replace
 to ' in corresponding lines.

11. Remove all untracked files:
git clean -f

12. Now there only 6 tracked modified files shows up:
#	modified:   src/cmp.c
#	modified:   src/diff.c
#	modified:   src/diff3.c
#	modified:   src/dir.c
#	modified:   src/sdiff.c
#	modified:   src/util.c

Then put these patch into file quote-3.0-patch.txt:
git diff > quote-3.0-patch.txt

13. Following the instructions in README-hacking and build:
./bootstrap
./configure
make
make check

Check the result:
diff . -
diff --help

output:
diff: cannot compare '-' to a directory
....
which is the expected result that no ` appear

14. Copied original diffutils v3.0 to directory diffutils-3.0, and the modified version to 
directory diffutils-3.0-patch and run:
D/diff -pru diffutils-3.0 diffutils-3.0-patch >quote-3.0-test.txt

15. Comparing the two files by diff:
diff quote-3.0-test.txt quote-3.0-patch.txt

The result shows that the two files are not exactly same, the different part are some useless 
lines such as the ` and ' character difference in comments.
